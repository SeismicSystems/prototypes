# Prototypes

Welcome to the **Seismic** blockchain's **Prototypes** repository! This repo is designed to help beta users build new projects on the Seismic blockchain, while serving as a collection of example code for anyone interested in learning how to work with Seismic. Each project in this repo lives in its own directory and comes with a dedicated README providing further details.

## Purpose

This repository exists for:

- **Reference & Examples:** Developers looking to understand the Seismic blockchain or seeking best practices can explore these prototypes as real-world examples.
- **Collaboration:** We encourage contributions, feedback, and discussions about all things Seismic.

Each project in this repo lives in its own directory and includes a dedicated README that provides more details.

## Projects Overview

Below is a quick summary of each prototype currently available in this repository:

1. **`RIFF`**  
   Listen to a bonding curve.

## Contributing

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create** a new branch for your prototype or feature.

4. **Open** a pull request describing your changes and why they're valuable.

We're excited to see what you build and look forward to collaborating on the future of Seismic!
