# Pay It Forward
### Pay it forward, get paid back

### Problem
The crypto community wants to foster communal spirit through shared generosity, but there aren't any platforms that specifically incentivize altruism while focusing on transparency and privacy.

### Insight
By using shielded data types for transactions and chain details, we can keep track of necessary data without participants being able to determine the characteristics of the ongoing chain. Being able to encrypt these details is key to building a fair and viable competition.

### Solution
Our solution is a competition to create the longest and farthest reaching pay it forward chain. By building on people's competitive and generous nature we can create a competition wherein the focus is to help your fellow man and be rewarded by doing so.
