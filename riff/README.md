# RIFF

## Problem
Trading experience on every Automated Market Maker (AMM) is the same, it's time for something radically different like Riff.

## Insight
What if we used other senses like hearing to make calls?

## Solution
Encrypt a bonding curve to create an asset with a price that no one can see. Let an AI violin be the only party that can see the price. The violin generates music whenever it sees price fluctuations. Now, instead of seeing a price chart, users need to listen to it.
