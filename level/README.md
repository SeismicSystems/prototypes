# Level Protocol

> Stabilize your depin service

## Overview

Level Protocol provides price stability for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) to ensure consistent service quality and network growth.

### Problem

DePIN projects that rely on token incentives to bootstrap service operators are highly vulnerable to token price fluctuations. A sharp drop in token value can cause operators to exit the network entirely, triggering a feedback loop that rapidly degrades service quality and coverage.

### Insight

We can lighten the burden of token volatility on operators by making the price not viewable, while still guaranteeing a minimum withdrawal value. Network quality will be more stable and able to grow faster.

### Solution

Our project introduces a token with an obscured exchange rate, ensuring operators receive rewards above a base price set by the protocol each epoch, covering estimated operating costs.
