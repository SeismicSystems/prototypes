# LEVEL Protocol

## Overview

LEVEL ensures stable network coverage for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) independent of token price fluctuations during the initial bootstrapping phase.

### Problem

DePIN projects that rely on token incentives to bootstrap service operators are highly vulnerable to token price fluctuations. When token prices surge, coverage rapidly expands, but can contract just as quickly during price downturns. This cyclical pattern makes it difficult to maintain consistent service quality and coverage.

### Insight

We can decouple network coverage from token price volatility by temporarily obscuring the exchange rate during the critical bootstrapping period, while still guaranteeing a minimum withdrawal value. This allows the network to establish stable coverage patterns unencumbered by speculative responses to token movements.

### Solution

Our project introduces a token with an obscured exchange rate during the initial bootstrapping phase, ensuring operators receive rewards above a base price set by the protocol each epoch to covering estimated operating costs.
