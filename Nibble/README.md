# Nibble - Restaurant Revenue Sharing

### Overview

Nibble allows restaurants to mint tokens that entitle frequent customers to a portion of their revenue.

**Problem:**
Small businesses rely on strong local communities, but in cities with countless dining options, it's hard to stand out, attract an initial customer base, and maintain long-term engagement. Combined with thin margins emblematic of restaurants and price pressures from corporate competitors, enfranchsing our local businesses requires more than just consumer choice.

**Insight:**
By letting customers become partial owners, small businesses can foster a deeper sense of loyalty. When customers are invested, they spend more and are more likely to promote the restaurant through word-of-mouth and social media, increasing brand visibility. Additionally, they provide more valuable and constructive feedback, as they want the business to succeed, ultimately leading to better service, menu improvements, and a stronger community around the restaurant.

**Solution:**
Offer a platform where customer loyalty translates into a share of the restaurant's on-chain, encrypted revenue.
