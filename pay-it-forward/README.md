### Pay it forward, get paid back

### Problem
Traditional pay-it-forward chains can raise charitable funds, but they are often vulnerable to exploitation. Additionally, they tend to lack excitement, and most efforts remain local rather than global-limiting their overall impact.

### Insight
By gamifying the pay-it-forward process, we can make chains more engaging and encourage increased donations. People are motivated when they believe they will be a part of something big. By using a blockchain, we can expand the scope to be worldwide, amplifying reach and participation.


### Solution
Create a global pay-it-forward competition on consumer payment rails. The potential to wina portion of the prize pot adds a competitive spark, increasing excitement and contributions. By building on Seismic's ecrypted network, we can keep the chain information hidden so that every participant (new or returning) will feel that they have a chance to be a winner.
